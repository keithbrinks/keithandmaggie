							<p>Maggie sent Keith an email on Christian Mingle after seeing that he was from Holland, MI and had a ragdoll cat named Apple. They then chatted daily for the next two weeks about their mutual love of cats and binge-watching TV shows.</p>

							<p>On her 24th birthday, Maggie met Keith in person in the Lemonjello’s parking lot in downtown Holland, MI. It was Tulip Time and Keith circled the block twice trying to find a parking spot but couldn't, so they met in the parking lot by the dumpster. It all felt very sketchy. They went to Holland State Park and sat and talked on the pier and then to Captain Sundae for ice cream.</p>
